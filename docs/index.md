Redistricting is the process of redrawing state legislative and congressional district boundaries. This process occurs every 10 years following the decennial U.S. Census, and is based on numerous criteria, including population and geographical boundaries. When lawmakers draw district lines to entrench one partyâ€™s political power, some votes count more than others. *Gerrymandering* describes the intentional manipulation of district boundaries for political advantage, or to discriminate against a group of voters on the basis of their political views or race.

This group, started in Summer 2020, will learn about redistricting in the US, about quantitative ways to define and measure gerrymandering, and will develop new statistical tools and methods in support of fair representation.

More information to come soon. If you are interested in participating, please sign up on the group mailing list. For the time being, the meetings will be in the time slot (TBD) of the `GDA Reading Group <https://www.stat.washington.edu/mmp/geometry/reading-group17/html/gda-home.html>`_ and will be announced on both this list and the *geometry* mailing list.  

For student participants: You will not be required to make a presentation/lead a discussion, but if you plan to do so, you can sign up for 1 stat 600 credit with one of the organizers.
