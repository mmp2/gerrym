======================================
 Geometric Data Analysis Reading Group
======================================

**Summer 2020 meetings to resume...**

**The GDA group needs a webmaster/blogmaster** *write to mmp at stat dot washington dot you-know-what-3-letters to apply*


**Add yourself to the mailing list** `geometry@uw.edu <https://mailman1.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/geometry>`_ or email `Sam Koelle <mailto:sjkoelle@uw.edu>`_


`Yen-chi Chen <http://www.stat.washington.edu/~yenchic>`_ and `Marina Meila  < http://www.stat.washington.edu/mmp>`_

We will read and discuss foundational papers and themes of **Geometric Data Analysis** such as

 * what is Topological Data analysis
 * manifold learning algorithms
 * dimension estimation
 * the Laplacian: what it tells us about the data, how to estimate it

More information and a web page to come soon. If you are interested in participating, please email the organizers. We will aim to meet approximately every other week, i.e. to have 4-5 meetings this quarter. 

For student participants: You will not be required to make a presentation/lead a discussion of a paper this quarter, but if you plan to volunteer for one, you can sign up for 1 stat 600 credit with one of the organizers.  


**List of suggested papers for Spring 2019**

* Spectral clustering. Start with `this tutorial <https://www.stat.washington.edu/mmp/Papers/ch2.2-arxiv.pdf>`_ some variations `based on local PCA <https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1323>`_ and `this <https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2007>`_ , `path based  <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320307002038>`_ and `this one, with more meat but harder to read <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06206>`_ The tutorial(s) would take 1 session, with the extras another session. There are zillions more papers, and I could recommend also this short paper on Self-tuning spectral clustering FYI. 

* I also thought based on previous meetings that 1/2 meeting on comparing clusterings would be useful. I will add a tutorial and a few more refs shortly. 

* `Copula PCA <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4809-semiparametric-principal-component-analysis.pdf>`_
